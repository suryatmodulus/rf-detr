"""Backfill the outdated-version banner into already-published gh-pages trees.

Purpose:
    Populate the empty ``data-md-component="outdated"`` banner div that archived
    version trees already carry, and give it the same purple/centered/sticky styling
    and header-offset behavior ``docs/stylesheets/rf.css`` and
    ``docs/javascripts/version-banner.js`` give it, so readers of old docs see the
    same warning ``docs/theme/main.html`` renders for trees built after that theme
    change - not Material's default yellow, left-aligned banner with the header
    overlapping it.
Scope:
    ``mike`` never rebuilds an archived version tree, and the pinned dependencies a
    given tag was built with may not resolve today, so regenerating those trees is not
    an option. This patches the static HTML, CSS, and JS directly instead, the same way
    ``.github/workflows/docs-noindex-sweep.yml`` patches the robots meta tag. ``develop`` is
    patched alongside the numeric versions: it does rebuild on every push and then carries the
    styling natively, but until that next deploy its published ``stylesheets/rf.css`` has no
    banner rules and its ``extra_javascript`` list no ``version-banner.js``, so an injected
    banner would render in Material's default yellow, left-aligned, with the header
    overlapping it. Once a tree is rebuilt both patches detect the native content and skip.
    ``latest`` is never touched, and neither is the newest release directory: ``mike``
    publishes each release both under its own number and under ``latest``, so a reader there
    is on the current release. An earlier run that did banner it is undone by
    ``strip_from_current_release``. The newest release does get ``version-banner.js``, which
    is what keeps its natively built banner markup hidden.
Usage:
    Run ``python .github/scripts/inject_outdated_banner.py <gh-pages checkout root>``.
    Safe to re-run: previously injected content is replaced in place (so wording or style
    edits reach already-patched pages too), and anything not carrying our marker -
    including a genuine future rebuild - is left alone.
Outputs:
    Prints how many files were patched and exits 0. Exits nonzero only on an unexpected
    filesystem error; finding nothing to patch is not a failure.
Used by:
    ``.github/workflows/docs-noindex-sweep.yml``.
