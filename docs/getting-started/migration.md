description: Per-version migration guide for RF-DETR. Covers breaking changes and deprecated APIs for each release series.
---

# Migration Guide

Read each section between your current version and your target — every section covers only the delta between two adjacent releases.

```
1.4.x  →  1.5 →  1.6  →  1.7  →  1.8  →  1.9  →  1.10
```

You can apply all changes in one go; working through sections one release at a time and verifying between each step is optional but makes failures easier to isolate. Deprecated APIs emit a `DeprecationWarning`, while deprecated configuration fields emit a `FutureWarning`, until the version marked for removal. See the [Changelog](../changelog.md) for the full list of changes in each release.

## Upgrade 1.9 → 1.10

### Breaking changes

!!! warning "Breaking: `log_per_class_metrics` now defaults to `False`"

    `TrainConfig.log_per_class_metrics` defaults to `False` (was `True`). Per-class AP keys (`test/AP/<class>`, `val/AP/<class>`) are no longer emitted by default — validation/test now skip that per-class computation. Set it explicitly to restore the old behavior:

    ```python
    train_config = TrainConfig(log_per_class_metrics=True)
    ```

!!! warning "Breaking: `compute_val_loss` now defaults to `\"auto\"`"

    `TrainConfig.compute_val_loss` defaults to `"auto"` (was `True`). In `"auto"` mode, validation loss is computed only when something actually consumes it — a `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler monitoring `val/loss`, or a callback (e.g. `ModelCheckpoint(monitor="val/loss")`, early stopping) that requires it — and is skipped otherwise. For a default run with no such consumer, `val/loss` no longer appears in `metrics.csv`, TensorBoard, or W&B. Set it explicitly to restore the old unconditional behavior:

    ```python
    train_config = TrainConfig(compute_val_loss=True)
    ```

!!! warning "Breaking: validation evaluates one model, and `val/mAP_*` follows it"

    Validation now runs **one** forward pass per batch instead of two: through the EMA weights when `use_ema=True` (the default), through the base weights otherwise. `val/mAP_50_95`, `val/mAP_50`, `val/mAP_75`, `val/mAR`, and per-class `val/AP/<class>` therefore report the EMA model on a default run — they used to report the base model — while the matching `val/ema_*` namespace remains available. Best-checkpoint selection is unaffected in substance (it already preferred EMA), but the "regular" track no longer writes `checkpoint_best_regular.pth` on such runs; `checkpoint_best_total.pth` is copied from the EMA checkpoint.

    `val/F1` and `val/loss` (when computed) follow the same single forward, so they now describe the EMA model too — consistent with the mAP under the primary key, but a change of meaning if you monitor `val/loss` with a `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler, `ModelCheckpoint`, or early stopping.

    Restore the previous two-forward behavior, both metric namespaces and both checkpoint tracks:

    ```python
    train_config = TrainConfig(eval_base_model=True)
    ```

!!! warning "Breaking: `grad_accum_steps` now defaults to `1`"

    `TrainConfig.grad_accum_steps` defaults to `1` (was `4`), which changes the default effective batch size from 16 to 4 at the default `batch_size=4`. This is a training-semantics change, not just a throughput change — the optimization trajectory (and possibly convergence/final mAP) can differ from a run using the old default. `batch_size="auto"` runs are unaffected, since the auto-batch probe overwrites `grad_accum_steps` with its own recommendation. Restore the previous default:

    ```python
    train_config = TrainConfig(grad_accum_steps=4)
    ```

!!! warning "Breaking: optimizer parameter groups are now merged by hyperparameter"

    `get_param_dict` now builds one parameter group per distinct learning-rate/weight-decay combination instead of one group per parameter (`rfdetr-nano` goes from 465 groups to 28). Layer-wise LR decay and per-parameter weight decay are preserved, and the resulting AdamW steps are bit-identical; checkpoints saved with the old per-parameter layout resume automatically. If you pass an explicit `lr_scheduler` whose `lr_scheduler_kwargs` include a list sized to a specific parameter-group count (e.g. `LambdaLR`'s per-group `lr_lambda`), resize that list to match the new (smaller) group count.

!!! warning "Breaking: dataset builders require a complete pipeline-option namespace"

    `build_roboflow_from_coco`, `build_roboflow_from_yolo`, and `build_o365_raw` now raise instead of silently substituting a default when the config namespace passed to them is missing `square_resize_div_64`, `segmentation_head`, `multi_scale`, `expanded_scales`, `do_random_resize_via_padding`, `patch_size`, or `num_windows` (`build_o365_raw` doesn't take `segmentation_head` — detection-only). Calling these with a complete `TrainConfig`/`ModelConfig` (the normal `.train()`/`RFDETRDataModule` path) is unaffected — this only affects callers who assemble a partial config namespace by hand and pass it to these builders directly. Supply every field on that namespace to fix it:

    ```python
    # Before — missing fields silently fell back to (sometimes wrong) defaults
    build_roboflow_from_coco(args=partial_namespace)

    # After — supply every pipeline option the builder needs, matching your
    # model variant's ModelConfig (patch_size varies by variant — 12, 14, or
    # 16 — read it from your ModelConfig rather than hardcoding it)
    partial_namespace.square_resize_div_64 = True
    partial_namespace.segmentation_head = False
    partial_namespace.multi_scale = True
    partial_namespace.expanded_scales = True
    partial_namespace.do_random_resize_via_padding = False
    partial_namespace.patch_size = model_config.patch_size
    partial_namespace.num_windows = model_config.num_windows
    build_roboflow_from_coco(args=partial_namespace)
    ```

### Deprecated in v1.10 → Remove in v1.13

!!! note "`eval_ema_only` is deprecated"

    Evaluating only the selected model is the default. Explicit legacy `TrainConfig(eval_ema_only=True)` preserves EMA-only evaluation and emits a `FutureWarning`; explicit `eval_ema_only=False` is migrated to the old base-plus-EMA behavior and also warns. Drop the field from new configurations. Use `eval_base_model=True` if you want the base model evaluated as well; `eval_ema_only=True` still requires `use_ema=True` and conflicts with that opt-in.

    One improvement for existing `eval_ema_only` users: `val/mAP_50_95` is now populated (with the EMA score) instead of staying absent, so monitors pointed at it start receiving values again.

---

## Upgrade 1.8 → 1.9

### Breaking changes

!!! warning "Breaking: `albumentations` and `kornia` extras merged into `augment`"

    **PyPI extras renamed.** Default training/validation/prediction/export augmentations now use torchvision-native transforms, so `[train]` no longer installs Albumentations. Custom CPU (Albumentations) and GPU (Kornia) augmentation both live behind a single new `augment` extra.

    | Old extra                                | New extra               |
    | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
    | `rfdetr[train]` (implied albumentations) | `rfdetr[train,augment]` |
    | `rfdetr[kornia]`                         | `rfdetr[augment]`       |

    ```bash
    # Before
    pip install 'rfdetr[train]'    # bundled albumentations
    pip install 'rfdetr[kornia]'

    # After
    pip install 'rfdetr[train,augment]'   # custom aug_config or GPU backend
    pip install 'rfdetr[augment]'
    ```

!!! note "`augmentation_backend` values renamed"

    `augmentation_backend="tv"` and `"albu"` are renamed to `"torchvision"` and `"albumentations"`. The old strings (and `"gpu"`) still work as aliases, so no code changes are required — see [Augmentation Backend Values](../learn/train/augmentations.md#augmentation-backend-values) for the full accepted set.

!!! warning "Breaking: default resize interpolation changed — pixel values and mAP may shift"

    The default resize backend changed from Albumentations (cv2 `INTER_LINEAR`, no antialias) to torchvision (`BILINEAR` + `antialias=True`). Resized pixel values differ slightly from previous versions, and mAP may drift on existing benchmarks. **This affects training as well as validation and test preprocessing** — not just the training split.

    To restore the previous pixel-exact behaviour:

    ```bash
    pip install 'rfdetr[augment]'
    ```

    ```python
    from rfdetr.datasets.aug_configs import AUG_CONFIG

    train_config = TrainConfig(aug_config=AUG_CONFIG)
    ```

    Installing `rfdetr[augment]` alone is **not** sufficient to pin this behaviour — with Albumentations installed, `augmentation_backend="auto"`/`"cpu"` (the default) auto-selects Albumentations for you, but identical code on a machine without `[augment]` installed silently falls back to torchvision instead. The only setting that pins resize behaviour regardless of what is installed is:

    ```python
    train_config = TrainConfig(augmentation_backend="torchvision")
    ```

### Removed

The following APIs were deprecated in earlier releases and are removed as of v1.9. Update your code before upgrading.

!!! warning "Removed: `rfdetr.util.*` and `rfdetr.deploy.*` import paths"

    Deprecated since v1.6, removed in v1.9. Use the canonical replacements listed in the [Upgrade 1.5 → 1.6](#upgrade-15--16) section.

    ```python
    # These imports now raise ImportError; update to the canonical paths
    from rfdetr.util.coco_classes import COCO_CLASSES  # → rfdetr.assets.coco_classes
    from rfdetr.util.misc import get_rank  # → rfdetr.utilities
    from rfdetr.deploy import export_onnx  # → rfdetr.export.main
    ```

!!! warning "Removed: `build_namespace(model_config, train_config)`"

    Deprecated since v1.7, removed in v1.9. Use `build_model_from_config` and `build_criterion_from_config` instead.

!!! warning "Removed: `load_pretrain_weights(nn_model, model_config, train_config)` with `train_config`"

    Deprecated since v1.7, removed in v1.9. Drop the `train_config` positional argument.

!!! warning "Removed: `start_epoch` kwarg in `train()`"

    Deprecated since v1.7, removed in v1.9. PyTorch Lightning resumes automatically via `resume=`.

!!! warning "Removed: `do_benchmark` kwarg in `train()`"

    Deprecated since v1.7, removed in v1.9. Use the `rfdetr.export.benchmark` module instead.

!!! warning "Removed: `callbacks` dict kwarg in `train()`"

    Deprecated since v1.7, removed in v1.9. Pass PTL `Callback` objects directly via the Lightning API instead.

!!! warning "Removed: misplaced config fields"

    The following `TrainConfig` and `ModelConfig` fields moved to their correct config class in v1.7; the deprecated compatibility shims are removed in v1.9. Passing one of these fields on its old config class now raises a pydantic validation error:

    | Field               | Removed from  | Use in        |
    | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
    | `group_detr`        | `TrainConfig` | `ModelConfig` |
    | `ia_bce_loss`       | `TrainConfig` | `ModelConfig` |
    | `segmentation_head` | `TrainConfig` | `ModelConfig` |
    | `num_select`        | `TrainConfig` | `ModelConfig` |
    | `cls_loss_coef`     | `ModelConfig` | `TrainConfig` |

!!! warning "Removed: `RFDETRLarge` silent fallback to deprecated Large config"

    `RFDETRLarge()` no longer catches checkpoint/config incompatibility errors and silently retries with `RFDETRLargeDeprecatedConfig`. Loading legacy deprecated-Large weights through `RFDETRLarge` now raises the original `ValueError`/`RuntimeError` instead of falling back. `RFDETRLargeDeprecated` itself is unaffected — use it directly to load those checkpoints.

    ```python
    # Before (silently retried with the deprecated config and logged a warning)
    model = RFDETRLarge(pretrain_weights="old_large_checkpoint.pth")

    # After
    from rfdetr import RFDETRLargeDeprecated

    model = RFDETRLargeDeprecated(pretrain_weights="old_large_checkpoint.pth")
    ```

### Deprecated in v1.9 → Remove in v1.11

!!! note "Deprecated: `RFDETR.optimize_for_inference()` renamed to `RFDETR.inference()`"

    **`optimize_for_inference(compile=..., batch_size=..., dtype=..., inplace=..., compile_backend=...)`** — renamed to `inference()` with the same signature.

    ```python
    # Before (deprecated)
    model.optimize_for_inference(dtype=torch.float16)

    # After
    model.inference(dtype=torch.float16)
    ```

!!! note "Deprecated: `TrainConfig.lr_drop` and `TrainConfig.lr_min_factor`"

    **`lr_drop` / `lr_min_factor`** — pass them through `lr_scheduler_kwargs` instead. For the managed `"step"` / `"cosine"` presets the fields are still folded into `lr_scheduler_kwargs` (with a `FutureWarning`); set with an explicit scheduler they are inert and warn.

    ```python
    # Before (deprecated)
    TrainConfig(lr_scheduler="step", lr_drop=80, lr_min_factor=0.1)

    # After
    TrainConfig(lr_scheduler="step", lr_scheduler_kwargs={"lr_drop": 80, "min_factor": 0.1})
    ```

### Deprecated in v1.9 → Remove in v1.12

!!! note "`rfdetr.datasets.aug_config` is deprecated"

    The module was renamed to `rfdetr.datasets.aug_configs` (plural) in v1.8.0 — see the "Upgrade 1.7 → 1.8" section below, where it is listed as a breaking change because that rename shipped with no compatibility shim. A shim was added in v1.9.0, so the singular path imports again and emits a `FutureWarning`. It is scheduled for removal in **v1.12.0**; migrate before then.

    The preset constants are unchanged — only the module path moves.

    ```python
    # Before (deprecated, warns since v1.9.0)
    from rfdetr.datasets.aug_config import AUG_AGGRESSIVE

    # After
    from rfdetr.datasets.aug_configs import AUG_AGGRESSIVE
    ```

---

## Upgrade 1.7 → 1.8

### Breaking changes

!!! note "Breaking in v1.8.2: default keypoint schema changed to active-first `[17]`"

    New checkpoints created from v1.8.2 onwards use `class_id=0` for person. Legacy `[0, 17]` checkpoints are still supported — RF-DETR auto-detects the schema from the checkpoint at load time.

    If your post-processing code offsets class IDs by 1 (common for background-first models), update it:

    ```python
    # Before (background-first [0, 17]: person was at class_id=1)
    class_name = "person" if detection.class_id == 1 else "other"

    # After (active-first [17]: person is at class_id=0)
    class_name = "person" if detection.class_id == 0 else "other"
    ```

    Use `detection.data["class_name"]` for schema-agnostic name resolution.

!!! warning "Breaking: `rfdetr.datasets.aug_config` renamed to `rfdetr.datasets.aug_configs`"

    The augmentation config module was renamed (singular → plural). If you import from it directly:

    ```python
    # Before
    from rfdetr.datasets.aug_config import AUG_AGGRESSIVE

    # After
    from rfdetr.datasets.aug_configs import AUG_AGGRESSIVE
    ```

    All preset constants (`AUG_AGGRESSIVE`, `AUG_CONSERVATIVE`, etc.) are unchanged.

!!! warning "Breaking: `supervision>=0.29.0` now required"

    Required for `sv.KeyPoints` support. `pip install rfdetr==1.8.0` pulls this automatically. If another dependency pins `supervision<0.29.0`, resolve the conflict manually.

!!! warning "Breaking: `pyDeprecate` constraint narrowed to `>=0.9,<0.10`"

    Was `>=0.6,<0.8`. If another package pins an older version, resolve with:

    ```bash
    pip install "rfdetr==1.8.0" "pyDeprecate>=0.9,<0.10"
    ```

---

## Upgrade 1.6 → 1.7

### Breaking changes

!!! warning "Breaking: `peft` removed from the default install"

    LoRA fine-tuning now requires the `lora` extra. If you use LoRA adapters during training, update your install command.

    ```bash
    # Before
    pip install rfdetr

    # After
    pip install 'rfdetr[lora]'
    ```

!!! warning "Breaking: `predict()` stores source image in `detections.metadata`"

    **`predict()` stores the source image in `detections.metadata`, not `detections.data`.**

    ```python
    # Before (1.6.4 and earlier)
    source = detections.data["source_image"]

    # After
    source = detections.metadata["source_image"]
    ```

!!! warning "Breaking: `pyDeprecate` constraint changed to `>=0.6,<0.8`"

    Was `>=0.3,<0.6`. If another package pins an older version, resolve with:

    ```bash
    pip install "rfdetr==1.7.0" "pyDeprecate>=0.6,<0.8"
    ```

### Deprecated in v1.7 → Remove in v1.9

!!! note "Deprecated: `build_namespace()` split into two functions"

    **`build_namespace(model_config, train_config)`** — use `build_model_from_config` or `build_criterion_from_config` instead.

    ```python
    # Before (deprecated)
    from rfdetr.models import build_namespace

    ns = build_namespace(model_config, train_config)

    # After
    from rfdetr.models import build_model_from_config, build_criterion_from_config

    model = build_model_from_config(model_config)
    criterion = build_criterion_from_config(model_config, train_config)
    ```

!!! note "Deprecated: `load_pretrain_weights()` no longer takes `train_config`"

    **`load_pretrain_weights(nn_model, model_config, train_config)`** — drop the `train_config` positional argument.

    ```python
    # Before (deprecated)
    from rfdetr.models import load_pretrain_weights

    load_pretrain_weights(nn_model, model_config, train_config)

    # After
    from rfdetr.models import load_pretrain_weights

    load_pretrain_weights(nn_model, model_config)
    ```

!!! note "Deprecated: config fields moved between `ModelConfig` and `TrainConfig`"

    **Config fields placed in the wrong config object.** Move them as shown:

    | Field               | Was in        | Move to       |
    | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
    | `group_detr`        | `TrainConfig` | `ModelConfig` |
    | `ia_bce_loss`       | `TrainConfig` | `ModelConfig` |
    | `segmentation_head` | `TrainConfig` | `ModelConfig` |
    | `num_select`        | `TrainConfig` | `ModelConfig` |
    | `cls_loss_coef`     | `ModelConfig` | `TrainConfig` |

    ```python
    # Before (deprecated)
    train_config = TrainConfig(group_detr=13, cls_loss_coef=2.0)

    # After
    model_config = ModelConfig(group_detr=13)
    train_config = TrainConfig(cls_loss_coef=2.0)
    ```

### Deprecated in v1.7 → Remove in v2.0

!!! note "Deprecated: `RFDETRBase` replaced by size-specific classes"

    **`RFDETRBase`** defaulted to the small variant and is replaced by size-specific classes. Choose the variant that matches your previous model size. If you used `RFDETRBase()` without arguments, switch to `RFDETRSmall()`.

    ```python
    # Before (deprecated)
    from rfdetr import RFDETRBase

    model = RFDETRBase()

    # After — pick one
    from rfdetr import RFDETRNano, RFDETRSmall, RFDETRMedium, RFDETRLarge

    model = RFDETRSmall()
    ```

!!! note "Deprecated: `RFDETRSegPreview` replaced by size-specific segmentation classes"

    **`RFDETRSegPreview`** defaulted to the small variant and is replaced by size-specific segmentation classes. If you used `RFDETRSegPreview()` without arguments, switch to `RFDETRSegSmall()`.

    ```python
    # Before (deprecated)
    from rfdetr import RFDETRSegPreview

    model = RFDETRSegPreview()

    # After — pick one
    from rfdetr import RFDETRSegNano, RFDETRSegSmall, RFDETRSegMedium, RFDETRSegLarge

    model = RFDETRSegSmall()
    ```

## Upgrade 1.5 → 1.6

### Breaking changes

!!! warning "Breaking: `transformers` minimum version raised to `>=5.1.0`"

    **`transformers` minimum version raised to `>=5.1.0,<6.0.0`.**

    Projects pinned to `transformers<5.0.0` must upgrade. If upgrading is not possible, pin `rfdetr<1.6.0`.

    ```bash
    pip install 'transformers>=5.1.0,<6.0.0'
    ```

!!! warning "Breaking: PyPI extras renamed"

    **PyPI extras renamed.**

    Update your `pip install` commands and `requirements*.txt` files.

    | Old extra            | New extra         |
    | -------------------- | ----------------- |
    | `rfdetr[metrics]`    | `rfdetr[loggers]` |
    | `rfdetr[onnxexport]` | `rfdetr[onnx]`    |

    ```bash

    pip install 'rfdetr[onnxexport]'

    # After
    pip install 'rfdetr[loggers]'
    pip install 'rfdetr[onnx]'
    ```

!!! warning "Breaking: `draw_synthetic_shape()` now returns a tuple"

    **`draw_synthetic_shape()` now returns `(image, polygon)` instead of `image`.**

    Update every call site that unpacks only the image.

    ```python
    # Before
    img = draw_synthetic_shape(...)

    # After
    img, polygon = draw_synthetic_shape(...)
    ```

### Deprecated in v1.6 → Removed in v1.8

!!! note "Deprecated: `simplify` and `force` arguments in `RFDETR.export()`"

    **`RFDETR.export(..., simplify=..., force=...)`** — both arguments are no-ops. Remove them from your calls.

    ```python
    # Before (deprecated)
    model.export("model.onnx", simplify=True, force=True)

    # After
    model.export("model.onnx")
    ```

### Deprecated in v1.6 → Remove in v1.9

!!! note "Deprecated: `rfdetr.util.*` and `rfdetr.deploy.*` import paths"

    Backward-compatibility shims are still active but emit `DeprecationWarning` on import. Replace with the canonical paths listed in the table below.

    | Deprecated module                 | Canonical replacement              |

## Upgrade 1.4 → 1.5

### Breaking changes

!!! warning "Breaking: `ModelConfig` rejects unknown keyword arguments"

    **`ModelConfig` now raises `ValidationError` on unknown keyword arguments.**

    Previously, unrecognised fields were silently ignored. Remove or rename any unrecognised keys you pass to `ModelConfig(...)`.

    ```python
    # Before — silently accepted

    # Now raises ValidationError — remove the unknown key
    config = ModelConfig()
    ```

### Deprecated in v1.5 → Removed in v1.7

!!! note "Deprecated: `OPEN_SOURCE_MODELS` replaced by `ModelWeights` enum"

    **`OPEN_SOURCE_MODELS` constant** — use the `ModelWeights` enum instead. A `DeprecationWarning` is emitted on access. See the [API reference](../reference/rfdetr.md) for available enum values.

    ```python
    # Before (deprecated)
    from rfdetr import OPEN_SOURCE_MODELS

    # After
    from rfdetr.assets.model_weights import ModelWeights
    ```
